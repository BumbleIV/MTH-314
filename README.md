**Notes from BumbleIV:** 
- I am self-teaching the content of MTH 314 to complement and demonstrate my profiency in Python and relevant Machine Learning techonlogies, as well as my understanding of Linear Algebra. 

- As of January 2022, I am not currently taking this class officially through Michigan State University.

- The content in this repository will be notes derived from a previous semester version of the course, and personal notes such as general code for performing Guassian Elimination on matrices of any dimension.
